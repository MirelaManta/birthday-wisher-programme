### Birthday Wisher
__If you want to never forget to wish your loved ones happy birthday, check out this code.__  

Using the knowledge gained on sending emails with smtplib, as well as reading csv files with pandas library, I created a programme that checks if the current day matches a birthday from the birthdays.csv file. If there is indeed a match, a letter will be randomly chosen from the letter_templates folder and emailed to the birthday person, personalized with the matching name.
